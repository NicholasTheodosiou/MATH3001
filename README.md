Project Title: "Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification".

Teacher: Dr Luisa Cutillo.

For Section 6 of my project, I will be investigating the Malaria Dataset found at: https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932.

The set consists of 27588 cell images, aqcuired by light microscopes attached on smartphone cameras. Half of the images are malaria infected cells and the other half are uninfected. The pre-processing of the data set is done by following Dr Adrian Rosebrocks' tutorial foun at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/12/03/deep-learning-and-medical-image-analysis-with-keras/. 

The images are classified using two several methods. That is, classification is performed using both a fully connected neural network and a convolutional neural network. 

* The data is imported by adjusting the first part of the Dogs vs Cats classifier found at: https://pythonprogramming.net/loading-custom-data-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/

* The training of the fully connected neural network (MALARIA_MNIST) is done by adjusting the Fashion MNIST classifier found at: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification

* The training of the CNN (MALARIA_DOGS_CATS) is done by adjusting the Dogs vs Cats Classifier found at: https://pythonprogramming.net/convolutional-neural-network-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/?completed=/loading-custom-data-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/

* Data visualisation is again performed by adjusting the MNIST classifier.
