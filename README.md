Project Title: "Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification".
Teacher: Dr Luisa Cutillo.
For Section 6 of my project, I will be investigating the Malaria Dataset found at: https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932
The set consists of 27588 cell images, aqcuired by light microscopes attached on smartphone cameras. Half of the images are malaria infected cells and the other half are uninfected. The pre-processing of the data set is done by following Dr Adrian Rosebrocks' tutorial foun at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/12/03/deep-learning-and-medical-image-analysis-with-keras/
